The exam is divided into the two parts that can be taken independently. A classroom is not marked because the date on uniweb is arbitrary, when you are ready for one of the two parts (oral with theory or project presentation) just write to Palazzi (or knock in the office) and arrange, even on dates outside the session. Usually the exam is given in his office.
